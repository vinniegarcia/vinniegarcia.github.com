#Welcome

My name is Vinnie Garcia. I am a Web developer currently residing in South Florida and looking for work. I'm not here to bore you with business jargon and details of my past accomplishments, but I will tell you that I have over 10 years of experience and a background in both business and technology, and that my work delivers results for my clients and employers. So let's get down to business. If you would like to know more about my past work, [download my resume](Vincent-Garcia-Resume.pdf) (PDF). If you like what you see, please [email me](mailto:vg@vinniegarcia.com) or call 954.xxx.xxxx to speak with me in person.
