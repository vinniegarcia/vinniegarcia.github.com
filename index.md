title: Websites, mobile apps and more in South Florida - Vinnie Garcia
---

#Welcome

My name is Vinnie Garcia. I am a Web and mobile app developer currently residing in South Florida. I've been doing this for a long time and I have experience with a wide variety of technologies, but my current passion is Javascript in its many forms: in the browser, on the server, in mobile apps, and anywhere else you can sling a prototype. I'm not here to bore you with business jargon and details of my past accomplishments, but I will tell you that my work delivers results for my clients and employers. So let's get down to business. If you would like to know more about my past work, [download my resume](/Vincent-Garcia-Resume.pdf) (PDF). If you like what you see, please [email me](mailto:vg@vinniegarcia.com) or call 954.933.8411 to speak with me in person. I like coffee and getting away from the computer to eat, so tell me something interesting and we can discuss working on it together.
