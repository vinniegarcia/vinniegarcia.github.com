# Hello, I'm Vinnie. I’m a human on this planet.

I’m a husband, a father, and a dog dad to three dogs. They all fill my home with love and joy and chaos and I can't get enough. The people I love are my anchor, my inspiration, and my constant reminder of what’s most important. When I’m not with them or working, you’ll probably find me chasing creativity. I do all kinds of things, but lately I've been trying to get into making music, drawing and painting, and taking walks to unexpected places. Traveling is a big passion of mine—it’s a way to experience fresh perspectives and find inspiration in unexpected corners of the world.

Building software is my job (Interested in hiring me? [Here's my resume](/docs/Vincent-Garcia-Resume.pdf)), and I love creating tools that make life easier or solve big challenges. But I'm more than some code or a job. I want to craft meaningful things that connect people, solve problems, and open up new possibilities, and I try to apply that philosophy throughout my entire life.

For me, life is about balance. It’s about weaving together all the things I care about: my work, my family, my creative pursuits, and my adventures. I don’t think any of us are defined by a single role or title. We’re a mix of everything we love, everything we create, and the people and animals we share it all with. That’s the life I’m building, and I’m grateful every day for the chance to do it.
