> Watch your thoughts, they become your words; watch your words, they become your actions; watch your actions, they become your habits; watch your habits, they become your character; watch your character, it becomes your destiny. - Lao Tzu

I'm a creature of habit. The familiar is easy to stick to and difficult to escape sometimes. That can lead to bad habits too. 

I've built good habits recently, and I'm proud of them. But I'm also aware that I need to keep working on them. I need to keep practicing them. I need to keep reinforcing them. I need to keep making them a part of my life. 

Habits are muscle builting. I'm working on the muscle-building of writing right now. Maybe I won't write the greatest magnum opus ever each day, but I will do my best to write something. Even if I'm the only reader.
