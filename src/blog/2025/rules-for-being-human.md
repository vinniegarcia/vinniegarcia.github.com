1. You will receive a body.
2. You will learn lessons.
3. There are no mistakes, only lessons.
4. A lesson is repeated until it is learned.
5. Learning lessons does not end.
6. "There" is no better than "Here."
7. Others are merely mirrors of you.
8. What you make of your life is up to you.
9. The answers lie inside you.
10. Your answers lie inside you.
11. You will forget all of this.
12. You can remember it whenever you want.

These rules date back to circa 1500BC. They play in my head a lot, especially lately. Different ones at different times in my life, but they're usually in the background or foreground somewhere. They're great reminders of the human experience. 

I will forget them again. And I will remember them again.
