    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I often think of an idea. Then I write it down. Then I make plans to work on it. Then I don&#39;t work on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made plans to work on this site for 10 years. I haven&#39;t touched it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&#39;s start again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is this about?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s about me. This used to be about my work, but that&#39;s limiting. I hope to add more than that. I do more than just my work. I want to do a good job there, but it&#39;s not the biggest or most rewrarding part of my life; that would be my family and loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll keep these posts around or delete them from time to time. It doesn&#39;t really matter. I am here again and I will make this relevant for right now and for later.&lt;/p&gt;
