        <p>I often think of an idea. Then I write it down. Then I make plans to work on it. Then I don't work on it.</p>
<p>I made plans to work on this site for 10 years. I haven't touched it.</p>
<p>So let's start again.</p>
<h2>What is this about?</h2>
<p>It's about me. This used to be about my work, but that's limiting. I hope to add more than that. I do more than just my work. I want to do a good job there, but it's not the biggest or most rewrarding part of my life; that would be my family and loved ones.</p>
<p>I don't know if I'll keep these posts around or delete them from time to time. It doesn't really matter. I am here again and I will make this relevant for right now and for later.</p>
