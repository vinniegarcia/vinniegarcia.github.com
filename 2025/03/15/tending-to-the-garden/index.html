<p>You have to get organized, Vinnie!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My dad seared these words into my brain when I was a teenager. I didn't understand them at the time, or maybe I didn't <em>want</em> to understand. But not being organized has bitten me in the ass more times than I can count. I've been trying to get better at it, and in no way can I say I'm great at it, but I am trying new things.</p>
<h2>Digital Gardening</h2>
<p>For a long time, I just dumped my stuff into folders and never looked at them again. I've been carrying a lot of junk! Junk I never even looked at after it was created or used! So I'm trying to clear that stuff out. I thought it would be useful one day, but it hasn't. I didn't need it.</p>
<h2>Paperwork</h2>
<p>Paperwork is a mess, frequently. There are times where I have avoided getting the mail so it doesn't add to the pile. I'm better now about just processing it. But I have a folder of stuff from the past year that needs a pass through. And most of my bills are paid automatically, but I still need to keep track of them. And it always seems like there are more of those than I can track!</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>The best way I've found to be organized at work is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Review the list of work to be done when you begin your day.</li>
<li>Sort it by (time/importance/whatever criteria is important to you)</li>
<li>Work on each item top to bottom.</li>
<li>Cross the items off as you go.</li>
<li>When the day ends, review your complete items.</li>
<li>Move your incomplete items to the top of the list for the next day.</li>
<li>Add new items to the bottom of the list.</li>
<li>Repeat tomorrow.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm at my best when I both know what I need to do and can offload what I don't need to immediately do to the list.</p>
<h2>Does this really help?</h2>
<p>Yeah it does, when I am consistent and diligent about these things. Am I? No. But I'm trying.</p>
<p>My dad was around my age when he told me to get organized. I almost took it as a personal attack at the time. He was just warning me. He had spent years being bitten by disorganized times and was trying to help me avoid the same fate. I still learned this the hard way, but I'm better off for it. Thanks Dad, I appreciate you.</p>
