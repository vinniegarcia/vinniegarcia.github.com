        <blockquote>
<p>Watch your thoughts, they become your words; watch your words, they become your actions; watch your actions, they become your habits; watch your habits, they become your character; watch your character, it becomes your destiny. - Lao Tzu</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm a creature of habit. The familiar is easy to stick to and difficult to escape sometimes. That can lead to bad habits too.</p>
<p>I've built good habits recently, and I'm proud of them. But I'm also aware that I need to keep working on them. I need to keep practicing them. I need to keep reinforcing them. I need to keep making them a part of my life.</p>
<p>Habits are muscle builting. I'm working on the muscle-building of writing right now. Maybe I won't write the greatest magnum opus ever each day, but I will do my best to write something. Even if I'm the only reader.</p>
