        <ol>
<li>You will receive a body.</li>
<li>You will learn lessons.</li>
<li>There are no mistakes, only lessons.</li>
<li>A lesson is repeated until it is learned.</li>
<li>Learning lessons does not end.</li>
<li>&quot;There&quot; is no better than &quot;Here.&quot;</li>
<li>Others are merely mirrors of you.</li>
<li>What you make of your life is up to you.</li>
<li>The answers lie inside you.</li>
<li>Your answers lie inside you.</li>
<li>You will forget all of this.</li>
<li>You can remember it whenever you want.</li>
</ol>
<p>These rules date back to circa 1500BC. They play in my head a lot, especially lately. Different ones at different times in my life, but they're usually in the background or foreground somewhere. They're great reminders of the human experience.</p>
<p>I will forget them again. And I will remember them again.</p>
