        <p>I didn't touch this website for 10 years since the last version. I finally redesigned it this weekend.</p>
<p>Over the past 4 months, I've made four websites myself and helped a friend breathe new life into three of his websites. I hadn't done that much work outside of my day job in years. It felt great.</p>
<p>Part of the absence was just being tired. After decades of working on software, and after a long day, sometimes the last thing you want to do is work on something like a website or app. You just want to spend time with family, or have a good dinner, or walk the dog and relax when you finish work.</p>
<p>A big part of it was just feeling like I had nothing to say, or being afraid to put it out there. I'm getting over that general feeling. But specifically, I'm going to put more here than just tech stuff. I'll put things I make, or places I go, or philosophies on life and the mind and whatever I feel like. This is my website. I'm going to determine what to put on it and not be afraid to express myself.</p>
<p>The internet and the web are not what they were when this website started in 2003 (yes, this website is old enough to buy alcohol!). It's less friendly, more corporate, more walled off. Instead of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUaTsSMSbcU">five giant websites, each with screenshots of the other four</a>, people ran their own sites. I used to do that, and I missed it, so here I am again.</p>
